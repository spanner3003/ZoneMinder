What's New
==========

1. See the ZoneMinder release notes for a list of new features:
     https://github.com/ZoneMinder/zoneminder/releases

2. The contents of the ZoneMinder Apache config file have changed. In
   addition, this ZoneMinder package now requires you to manually symlink the
   ZoneMinder Apache config file. See new install step 6 and upgrade step 3
   in the appropriate README for details.

3. This package has been split into sub-packages to allow compatibility with
   other web servers. Here is a breakdown of the available packages:

     zoneminder - Meta-package installs zoneminder-common and zoneminder-httpd
                  This exists soley for backwards compatibility.
     zoneminder-common - Common files that do not differ based on the web server
     zoneminder-httpd - Files needed for compatibility with the Apache web server
     zoneminder-nginx - Files needed for compatibility with the Nginx web server

   You can switch between different subpackages with dnf/yum. Be advised that,
   switching between httpd <-> nginx requires manaully changing ownership of
   all event folders and the php session folder after the change.

4. If you have installed ZoneMinder from the FedBerry repositories, this build
   of ZoneMinder has support for Raspberry Pi hardware acceleration when using
   ffmpeg. Unforunately, there is a problem with the same hardware acceleration
   when using libvlc. Consequently, libvlc support in this build of ZoneMinder
   has been disabled until the problem is resolved. See the following bug
   report for details: https://trac.videolan.org/vlc/ticket/18594

5. Continue on to the next README that corresponds to the chosen webserver:

     README.httpd - Follow these steps when using Apache
     README.nginx - Follow these steps when using Nginx
